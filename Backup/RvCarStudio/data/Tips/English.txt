# THIS IS Car Studio's English Tip file   
#--------------------------------------------
# if you want to modify it, you have just to write
#  Name: What's he going to say
# alternatively, it's possible to declare 'Name:' as a constant and use it as a variable
# ATTENTION:
# If we declare #Const halo = Halogaland:  and our dialogue contains a word containing 'halo' like in this example:
# 		(ZR) I started to speak German, halo everybody or it's Halo? or hallo?
# Car studio will interpret it as 
# 		(ZR) I started to speak German, Halogaland: everybody or it's Halo? or hallo?
# Thus make your constants more 'incontourable' like #Const _halo_ = Halogaland or #Const !UR! = Urbanrocker
# Note: it's case sensitive

# Constants go here
# declaring #Const will force Car studio to read it once then treat it as a commentary!
#----------------------------

#Const (CW) = CityWalker:
#Const (Halo) = Halogaland:
#Const (B94) = Burner94:
#Const (Nero) = Nero:
#Const (Skarma) = Skarma:
#Const (mm) = MythicMonkey:
#Const (kay) = kay:
#Const (Param) = Parameters Notes:
#Const (Note) = Note:

#----------------------------
# let's have some randomies! (will appear only at the beginning)
#----------------------------
	

	(Skarma) Simipour we love
	(B94) Chiby
	(Halo) Best parameters for me are those which makes you drive the car the best as you can. 
	(Halo) If you like drifting, then use drift parameters and if you, as me, love drag params, use them but make the car handleable anyway.
	(Halo) Personally the car is good first if you like it!  something you don't find ok isn't good enough (you should have objective point of view here)
	(kay) Also as Halo. mentionned it's possible to redo anything if it's not perfect.
	(Halo) Patience, focusing, perservance. The car you make deserve taking time! 
	(Halo) Don't worry about others opinions and improve your work!
	(Halo) If you rush stuffs, then, you car is completely... messed unless you're a professional (Take it easy)

# Main

# Contains Name,folder,ClothFx, Flying, Flippable,Light,CarEnv
Region name
	(kay) A good name should attract the players. Picking a name for an original car is usually proportional to download rate
End Region

Region folder
	Note: This is a direct-renamer and the folder is being renamed the moment you're writing.
End Region

Region clothfx
	(Param) Mystery car cloth effect (similar to laundry on strings)
End Region

Region flying
	(Param) Just Like UFO car
End Region

Region flippable
	(Param) Can be flipped like Rotor
End Region

Region light
	Note: Fictional Light.
End Region 

Region envcolor
	(Param) This is the declaration for the reflection color used by the car.

# GEOMETRY (mass,Inertia)
Region mass
	(kay) Mass is a very important value, it'll decide how cars feels, moves and do rotations.
	(Param) This is the car's total weight in kilograms. 1 kilogram is approximately 2.21 pounds.
	(Param)  R6 Turbo (lightest) weighs about 0.8 kilograms, and Bertha Ballistics (heaviest) weighs about 3 kilograms.
	(kay) Toyeca is around 2.0 and Adeon is around 1.2. Don't make it too light or too weighty.
	
End Region

Region inertia
	(Param) This is the car's inertia matrix. This helps determine the car's willingness to rotate or spin about the respective x, y, or z axis.
	(kay) Structure: [Ixx,0,0][0,Iyy,0][0,0,Izz] where Ixx is the torque once projected on X Plane
	(Param)  Higher values = more inertia (more willing to rotate) and lower values = less inertia (less willing to rotate).
	(CW) (CW's method) X's Inertia=ref_inertia*weight+(weight-1)*inertia_coeff*weight. Y=X*1.5 and Z=X*0.5
End Region


# DYNAMICS (Hardness, Air Res, Ang Res, ResMod,Grip, and frictions)

#I'm here

Region statfric
	(Skarma) Static friction is how much grip the car has normally when it's going straight or standing still.
	(Skarma) Kinetic friction is NEVER higher than the Static.
End Region

Region kineticfric
	(Skarma) Kinetic friction is how much it has when it is turning/skidding.
	(Skarma) Higher values give it more grip and makes it more difficult to spin, lower values is the opposite.
	(Skarma) Kinetic friction is NEVER higher than the Static .
	(mm) Basically you would need to know that a KineticFriction value of 1.95 equates to a quantifiable amount of grip on real-world tires.
	
End Region
Region body
	(Halo) Another mistake: making something too much lowpoly.
	(Halo) Avoiding the holes is really significant too, for the design of the car
	(Halo) For the shape of the car, try to make it as smooth as possible.
	(Halo) having the best shape of the car: TAKE YOUR TIME AND BE CAREFUL WITH THE FACES (there's a lot of tutorials for this)
End Region


Region bodydyn
	(B94) Those won't affect the car in noticeable way: SteerMod, DownForceMod, Gravity, Hardness, AngRes,Resistance.
	(B94) ResMod can be edited, putting it to 1 will increase real-feeling while in air. Put it 0 for real feel with bikes
	(B94) After altering Grip, frictions of the body is kind of useless as you don't want to ahve a body which grips better than car's tires when scrapping on the ground, huh?
End Region

Region bodygeo
	(B94) Those won't affect the car in noticeable way: SteerMod, DownForceMod, Gravity, Hardness, AngRes,Resistance.

[Random]


[Main]


[Body]


[Axis]
(Halo) In any program, the car axis should be centered on the car, it shouldn't be too much high or low (otherwise the params would be weird)

[Wheels]
(B94) Mass (most cars use a standard value, so who cares XD).
(B94) ToeIn (all cars use 0...)
(B94) AxleFriction (just affects directly the top speed and the slowdown ability of the car when accelerator isn't pressed, but all the stock cars use the same values.)

[Aerial]
(B94) It's also tricking to play around with aerial direction and coefficients.

[Handling]
(B94) SteerMod (pretty useless) | DownforceMod (2 is okay for all cars)
